ProxyChains ver 4.0 README
==========================

*********** ATTENTION ***********

this program works only on dynamically linked programs.
also both proxychains and the program to call must use
the same dynamic linker (i.e. same libc)

*********************************


This is Unix version only.

How to mess with sources - How to Install : read INSTALL !!!!!!

This program forces any tcp connection made by any given tcp client
to follow through proxy (or proxy chain). It is a kind of proxifier.
It acts like sockscap / permeo / eborder driver ( intercepts TCP calls )
It is FREE.

Changelog:
----------

Version (4.x) removes the dnsresolver script which required a dynamically
linked "dig" binary to be present with remote DNS lookup.
this speeds up any operation involving DNS, as the old script had to use TCP.
additionally it allows to use .onion urls when used with TOR.
also it removed the broken autoconf build system with a simple Makefile.
there's a ./configure script though for convenience.
it also adds support for a config file passed via command line switches/
environment variables.

Version (3.x) introduces support for DNS resolving through proxy 
it supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.
Auth-types: socks - "user/pass" , http - "basic".

When to use it ?
1) When the only way to get "outside" from your LAN is through proxy server.
2) To get out from behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing ports.
3) To use two (or more) proxies in chain:
	like: your_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target_host
4) To "proxify" some program with no proxy support built-in (like telnet)
5) Access intranet from outside via proxy.
5) To use DNS behind proxy.

Some cool features:

* This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain
	like: your_host <-->socks5 <--> http <--> socks4 <--> target_host
* Different chaining options supported
	random order from the list ( user defined length of chain ).
	exact order  (as they appear in the list )
	dynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)
* You can use it with any TCP client application, even network scanners
	yes, yes - you can make portscan via proxy (or chained proxies)
	for example with Nmap scanner by fyodor (www.insecire.org/nmap).
	proxychains nmap -sT -PO -p 80 -iR  (find some webservers through proxy)
* You can use it with servers, like squid, sendmail, or whatever.
* DNS resolving through proxy.


Configuration:
--------------

proxychains looks for config file in following order:
1)	file listed in environment variable ${PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE} or
	provided as a -f argument to proxychains script or binary.
2)	./proxychains.conf
3)	$(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
4)	/etc/proxychains.conf  **

**see more in /etc/proxychains.conf

Usage Example:

	bash$ proxychains telnet targethost.com

in this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies)
specified by proxychains.conf

Usage Example:

      	bash$ proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf targethost2.com

in this example it will use different configuration file then proxychains.conf 
to connect to targethost2.com host.

Usage Example:

	bash$ proxyresolv targethost.com

in this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies)
specified by proxychains.conf
